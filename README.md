Put your program description here.

The game is a copy of the classic web browser game snake. The point of the snake is to be There are three objects, the snake head, the snake body dots, and the apples. The player controls the snake head with arrows and eats the apples. Every time an apple is eaten a dot is added to the snake's body, therefore making the snake longer. The snake body dots follow the direction of the head, being exactly 1 dot behind it. The apples are spawned randomly using methods. If the snake hits the edge of the game screen, the game ends and shows the game lost screen. If the snake collides with itself, the game ends. The game continues on until the snake collides with something. The objective of the game is to end up with the highest score possible, the score is the length of the snake that’s been achieved by the number of apples that were eaten by the snake. The point of playing the snake game is to get better reaction time in avoiding the snake body and the game edge and to better understand space, a common strategy in snake is to try to take up as less space as possible to limit the chances of colliding with the snakes own body. However, the real purpose of snake is to be a fun browser game that anyone can play when they’re bored, there’s a reason why it’s one of the classics.
